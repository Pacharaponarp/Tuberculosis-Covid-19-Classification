# Tuberculosis-Covid-19-Classification
Tuberculosis/Covid-19 Chest X-ray Classification with Deep Learning

This project is part of the Individual Study I Course (Taken in semester 1 of 2021)
The repository consists of 5 files
1. indiv report.pdf - My report for the course(in Thai) explaining the work process and some of the results (results in the report might be outdated compared to the ipynb)
2.Tuberculosis(Shenzhen).ipynb - My model on the first dataset of the project, using deep learning to classify Tuberculosis patients. Dataset is available at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/raddar/tuberculosis-chest-xrays-shenzhen
3.Tuberculosis(Montgomery).ipynb - My model on the second dataset of the project, similar to #2 but for this dataset,I had a lot less data to work with. Dataset is not available due to protecting patient privacy.
4.Covid_Admitted.ipynb - My final model of the project, classifying COVID-19 patients who need to be admitted. The model I used is pretty similar to #3 but the result is much more accurate. Dataset is not available due to protecting patient privacy.
